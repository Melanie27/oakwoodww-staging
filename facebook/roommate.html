Facebook's roommate policy allows for same-sex roommates only.  Assignments will be primarily based on internship program start and end date, and secondarily based on the degree level of each intern so you may begin to develop a network of colleagues close to your graduation year.  The Housing Request Form includes a short set of survey questions, which will be used to further match roommates with similar preferences.</p><h3>May I request a roommate?</h3><p>Yes, interns may request a roommate to live with during their internship program.  The request for a roommate must be mutual between both parties.  The program start date for both interns must be the same.  Please remember, Facebook's roommate policy allows for same-sex roommates only.</p><h3>Can I have a relative or friend who is not a Facebook intern be my roommate?</h3><p>No, Facebook is paying the rent and other expenses per apartment; therefore living in corporate apartments provided by Facebook is a privilege for Facebook interns only.</p><h3>What if I want to bring my girlfriend/boyfriend along with me to my internship?</h3><p>Facebook's roommate policy allows for same-sex roommates only.  Living in a corporate apartment provided by Facebook is a privilege for Facebook interns only.  With the exception of spouses, significant others may not live in Facebook provided corporate apartments.</p><h3>Can I bring my spouse to my internship?</h3><p>Yes, Facebook provides one-bedroom apartments for interns whose spouse is accompanying them to their internship location.  The Housing Request Form includes a question about marital status and if spouses and/or children will be accompanying the intern to the program location.  Please contact Loan Nguyen, lnguyen@oakwood.com to discuss the number of children that will be accompanying an intern, and how many bedrooms are required.</p><h3>How many people will there be per apartment?</h3><p>There will only be one person per bedroom in an apartment.  The number of bedrooms per apartment will vary.</p><h3>Will I have my own bathroom?</h3><p>Standard apartments have two bedrooms and one bathroom.  Each person will have their own bedroom.</p><h3>When will I know who my roommate is?</h3><p>Your Oakwood Apartment Community and Roommate(s) will be assigned no less than 14 days prior to your program start date.  Your Oakwood Representative, Loan Nguyen, will e-mail your roommate's name and contact information, as well as your internship apartment community address.  Your unit number, detailed arrival instructions, and where to collect your keys will be e-mailed to you three business days prior to your move-in date.  Should you have any questions about your reservation, please contact Loan Nguyen, lnguyen@oakwood.com.</p><h3>What if I do not get along with my roommate?</h3><p>Our first request is that you try to work out the issue using open lines of communication and constructive feedback methods.  If you are unable to work out your issues, you should contact your Oakwood Representative, Loan Nguyen.</p></div></div><div class="footer">&copy; 2004 - 2011 Oakwood Worldwide / The most trusted name in temporary housing.
