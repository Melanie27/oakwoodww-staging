<h1>Facebook Interns Move-out Instructions</h1>
<h3>Intent to Vacate (ITV) Notice:</h3>
<p>No fewer than 10 business days prior to your scheduled move-out date, Oakwood will e-mail you to confirm your scheduled move-out date.  This e-mail will also provide specific move-out instructions for your specific unit and property. 
On the scheduled day of your move-out, you have until midnight to completely vacate your apartment. 
Upon your move out, we ask that you remove your food items, trash, and all personal belongings.</p>
<h3>Move-out Date Change:</h3>
<p>If your move-out date changes because your internship has been extended, Oakwood will advise Facebook of the request for extension to get approval.  Oakwood will attempt to extend your housing in the same unit, based on availability.  There is a possibility you may need to change apartments, however, this will be avoided if at all possible.</p>
<p>If your move-out date changes due to personal reasons, you will assume full financial responsibility of the rent for days stayed beyond Facebook&rsquo;s financial obligation, and you will be responsible for making payments to Oakwood directly.  Oakwood will attempt to extend your housing in the same unit, based on availability.  There is a possibility you may need to change apartments.</p>
<h3>Apartment Inspection:</h3>
<p>Your apartment and bedroom will be inspected during the last Housekeeping visit prior to your departure.  During the inspection, the inspector will look for damages to the apartment.  Should any by found, both roommates will be notified and charges may be assessed based on the severity of the damages beyond normal wear and tear.</p>
<h3>Keys/remotes/access cards:</h3>
<p>Leave all keys/remotes/access cards in an envelope labeled with your name/building/apt.# on the coffee table, except for the 1 door key that you use to lock the apartment upon your departure.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lockbox:</strong> Take the door key that you lock the apartment with and place it back in the lockbox on the front door/(refer to lock box instructions)</li>
<li><strong>Leasing Office:</strong> if your check-in did not come with a lock box, take the door key to the Leasing Office in an envelope labeled with your name/building/apt.# during business hours or to their drop box if your departure is after business hours.</li>
</ul>
<p>For each item not returned a $200.00 fee will be assessed.</p>
<p>Please be sure to leave the modem in the apartment to avoid any inconvenience to the next guest.</p>
<p>Thank You for Staying With Oakwood during your Facebook Internship program!  We hope you have enjoyed your stay and look forward to welcoming you back to Oakwood  in the future.</p>
