Additionally, Oakwood does not place utility or local phone service caps upon our clients and their guests.

<h3>Where will the apartment community be located?</h3>
<p>We strive to house interns in locations as close to the Facebook campus as possible. All apartment communities used for intern housing are approved by Facebook, and will include daily transportation to and from campus. You will be notified of your assigned apartment community 14 days prior to your internship program start date.</p>
<h2 id="reservations">Making Reservations</h2>
<h3>What is the registration deadline for my housing?</h3>
<p>The deadline for reserving your housing is 14 days after receiving the initial e-mail from Cynthia Loveless. <a href="https://www.oakwood.com/action/oakwood/lead/bookRequest?requestType=1280&amp;facebookForm=true&amp;clearForm=true&amp;source=lpcn_321994&amp;sourceSessionOverride=t">Click here to submit your Housing Request</a>.</p>
<h3>What role does Facebook play when securing housing?</h3>
<p>Facebook is responsible for approving the housing selected, and forwarding your contact information to Oakwood Corporate Housing once you are accepted into the internship program. Receipt of this information serves to confirm you as a Facebook intern, and Oakwood will initiate the housing process. Shortly after receiving the relocation kick-off e-mail from Facebook, Oakwood will send an introduction email to each intern containing the link to the Oakwood Landing page and instructions on completing the online Housing Request Form. From that point, Oakwood will handle the entire housing process.</p>
<h3>How do I make a reservation?</h3>
<p>To submit your housing request, complete the <a href="https://www.oakwood.com/action/oakwood/lead/bookRequest?requestType=1280&amp;facebookForm=true&amp;clearForm=true&amp;source=lpcn_321994&amp;sourceSessionOverride=t">Housing Request Form</a> on the Facebook Landing page.</p>
<h3>How will I receive my confirmation?</h3>
<p>Oakwood will e-mail your apartment address and roommate information to you 14 days prior to your program start date. A credit card is required for all reservations. A credit card authorization form will also be sent to you via email 14 days prior to your program start date.</p>
<h3>When will I know my address?</h3>
<p>Your Oakwood Apartment Community and Roomate(s) will be assigned no less than 14 days prior to your program start date. Your Oakwood Representative, Cynthia Loveless, will e-mail you the name and address of the apartment community, as well as your roommate's name and contact information. Your unit number, detailed arrival instructions, and where to collect your keys at the property will be e-mailed to you three business days prior to your move-in date. Should you have any questions about your reservation, please contact Cynthia Loveless, <a href="mailto:facebookhousing@oakwood.com" target="_new">facebookhousing@oakwood.com</a>.</p>
<h3>Why must I provide my credit card information if I have direct billing arrangements?</h3>
<p>A credit card is required to confirm your reservation and cover any damages incurred during the stay. This includes, but is not limited to, costs for repairing damages caused by you or your guests, except for normal wear and tear. Interns will be liable for payment of lost keys, gate passes, and garage door openers if applicable. Charges will also be incurred for these items (keys, gate passes, and garage door openers if applicable) if these items are not returned within 5 business days after departure date.</p>
<p>Should you choose to upgrade cable packages, add long distance calling to your phone service or add on any other items, a separate credit card authorization form will be required to authorize the additional upgrades and to apply the charges to your personal account.</p>
<h3>Do I need to sign a lease agreement?</h3>
<p>No, Facebook has guaranteed your apartment and no additional lease needs to be signed.</p>
<h3>May I see my apartment prior to move in?</h3>
<p>Oakwood apartments resemble one another by design, regardless of the actual apartment complex you are assigned. Each apartment includes a furniture package, kitchen package, linens, towels and other home items you would need while staying at your home away from home. Please visit the <a href="photo.html">Oakwood Photo Gallery</a> or take a <a href="video.html">Video Tour</a> of a standard Oakwood Apartment to see a sample selection of your future Oakwood apartment. If you have any questions about what is included with your apartment, please see the <a href="Oakwood_templateB 2.pdf" target="_new">Furnishings List</a>. Should you have any further questions, please contact Cynthia Loveless, <a href="mailto:facebookhousing@oakwood.com" target="_new">facebookhousing@oakwood.com</a>.</p>
<h3>Are smoking apartments available?</h3>
<p>Oakwood does not restrict smoking as part of our lease agreements. However, apartment communities where our guests reside may implement smoking policies. Oakwood expects our guests to comply with community policies while residing in these communities.</p>
<h3>Can I bring a pet?</h3>
<p>No pets are permitted, with the exception of documented service animals. Exceptions are dealt with on a case by case basis and require Facebook approval with signed documentation. Guests are financially responsible for non-refundable pet deposits, cleaning fees, and damages. Please contact Cynthia Loveless, <a href="mailto:facebookhousing@oakwood.com" target="_new">facebookhousing@oakwood.com</a> to get approval for your documented service animal.</p>
<h2 id="roommates">Roommates:</h2>
<h3>What is Oakwood's method for matching roommates?</h3>
<p>Roommates are assigned based on a set of specific criteria outlined by Facebook. Facebook's roommate policy allows for same-sex roommates only. Assignments will be primarily based on internship program start and end date, and secondarily based on the degree level of each intern so you may begin to develop a network of colleagues close to your graduation year. The Housing Request Form includes a short set of survey questions, which will be used to further match roommates with similar preferences.</p>
<h3>May I request a roommate?</h3>
<p>Yes, interns may request a roommate to live with during their internship program. The request for a roommate must be mutual between both parties. The program start date for both interns must be the same. Please remember, Facebook's roommate policy allows for same-sex roommates only.</p>
<h3>Can I have a relative or friend who is not a Facebook intern be my roommate?</h3>
<p>No, Facebook is paying the rent and other expenses per apartment; therefore living in corporate apartments provided by Facebook is a privilege for Facebook interns only.</p>
<h3>What if I want to bring my girlfriend/boyfriend along with me to my internship?</h3>
<p>Facebook's roommate policy allows for same-sex roommates only. Living in a corporate apartment provided by Facebook is a privilege for Facebook interns only. With the exception of spouses, significant others may not live in Facebook provided corporate apartments.</p>
<h3>Can I bring my spouse to my internship?</h3>
<p>Yes, Facebook provides one-bedroom apartments for interns whose spouse is accompanying them to their internship location. The Housing Request Form includes a question about marital status and if spouses and/or children will be accompanying the intern to the program location. Please contact Cynthia Loveless, <a href="mailto:facebookhousing@oakwood.com" target="_new">facebookhousing@oakwood.com</a> to discuss the number of children that will be accompanying an intern, and how many bedrooms are required.</p>
<h3>How many people will live in an apartment?</h3>
<p>There will only be one person per bedroom in an apartment. The number of bedrooms per apartment will vary.</p>
<h3>Will I have my own bathroom?</h3>
<p>Standard apartments have two bedrooms and one bathroom. Each person will have their own bedroom.</p>
<h3>When will I know who my roommate is?</h3>
<p>Your Oakwood Apartment Community and Roommate(s) will be assigned no less than 14 days prior to your program start date. Your Oakwood Representative, Cynthia Loveless, will e-mail your roommate's name and contact information, as well as your internship apartment community address. Your unit number, detailed arrival instructions, and where to collect your keys will be e-mailed to you three business days prior to your move-in date. Should you have any questions about your reservation, please contact Cynthia Loveless, <a href="mailto:facebookhousing@oakwood.com" target="_new">facebookhousing@oakwood.com</a>.</p>
<h3>What if I do not get along with my roommate?</h3>
<p>Our first request is that you try to work out the issue using open lines of communication and constructive feedback methods. If you are unable to work out your issues, you should contact your Oakwood Representative, Cynthia Loveless.</p>
<h2 id="moving">Moving In and Moving Out:</h2>
<h3>How long do I have before and after my internship to move?</h3>
<p>Facebook's policy provides a grace period of up to 6 days of corporate housing to use, if needed, for the purpose of relocating to your internship location. These days may be used at the beginning of your internship or after the end of our internship so you may more easily coordinate travel. The number of days allowed must not exceed 6 days, and must be used for relocation purposes only.</p>
<p>If you require more than 6 days before and after your program to move, you may extend your stay at your own expense if your assigned apartment is available. Please contact Cynthia Loveless for rates at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:facebookhousing@oakwood.com" target="_new">facebookhousing@oakwood.com</a>.</p>
<h3>The Housing Registration Form asks for an end date. How do I know what this is?</h3>
<p>Your internship end date is provided in your offer letter from Facebook. Once you have entered your end date on the Housing Request Form this date is considered FINAL. Should an internship extension occur, please notify your primary Oakwood contact Cynthia Loveless <a href="mailto:facebookhousing@oakwood.com" target="_new">facebookhousing@oakwood.com</a> at your earliest convenience. Housing extensions will be most efficiently accommodated if your apartment is available. To best accommodate your extension, and continue living in the same apartment, please contact Cynthia as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>What if I want to arrive earlier or stay longer than the Facebook policy allows?</h3>
<p>If the apartment is available, you are allowed to arrive as early, or extend your stay for as long as you like at your own expense. You will be responsible for the rent for days stayed outside of the Facebook policy. Please coordinate any early arrivals or late departures through Cynthia Loveless <a href="mailto:facebookhousing@oakwood.com" target="_new">facebookhousing@oakwood.com</a>.</p>
<h3>How do I make changes to my reservation or extend my stay?</h3>
<p>Adjustments to reservations due to changes with your internship program must be approved. Please contact your Oakwood representative, Cynthia Loveless, <a href="mailto:facebookhousing@oakwood.com" target="_new">facebookhousing@oakwood.com</a> as soon as you are aware of a change to your program.</p>
<p>For personal changes to your arrival or departure dates, please contact your Oakwood representative, Cynthia Loveless,<a href="mailto:facebookhousing@oakwood.com" target="_new"> facebookhousing@oakwood.com</a>. You will be responsible for the rent for days stayed outside of the Facebook policy.</p>
<h3>What are the Check-In and Check-Out times?</h3>
<p>Check-in time on your arrival date is after 3:30pm. We have the ability to handle a late/after-hours check-in at all of our intern housing locations. Check-out time is by midnight on your departure date.</p>
<h3>Can I ship packages to my apartment that may arrive before I do?</h3>
<p>We do not have the ability to accept and store packages that do not fit into your apartment mailbox, so we do not advise that you ship items to arrive prior to your check-in date, as the delivery may be turned away.</p>
<h2 id="living">Living in Your Apartment</h2>
<h3>Who do I contact if I have a service issue during my stay?</h3>
<p>Please contact the Oakwood Service Center 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days of the year at 866-344-0289 for any service issues or questions you may have about your apartment.</p>
<h3>Is renters insurance required?</h3>
<p>While renters insurance is not required, Oakwood strongly suggests acquiring renters insurance for your own personal protection. Neither Oakwood, nor Facebook, is responsible for any lost or stolen personal items.</p>
<h3>Who pays for damages in the apartment?</h3>
<p>Interns sharing an apartment are responsible for maintaining the apartment and keeping the apartment in good condition. Should there be damages to the apartment beyond normal wear and tear, the interns living in the apartment will be held equally liable for the damages and will therefore be equally charged.</p>
<h3>Will I need to organize transportation to and from my new work location?</h3>
<p>For those that choose to live in Facebook approved corporate housing, complimentary daily shuttle service will be provided to and from campus. To view the most updated transportation schedule for each apartment community, visit the Intern <a href="shuttle.html">Shuttle Transportation Schedule Page</a>.</p>
